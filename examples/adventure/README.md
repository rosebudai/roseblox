# 3D Adventure Template

Base template for Adventure games made on Rosebud.

## Context

Addresses the following prompts:

- "Open world adventure with treasure hunting"
- "Create an adventure game with puzzles and combat"
- "Quest-based adventure in a fantasy world"

## Development

### Building the Game Engine

If you make changes to the roseblox-game-engine, you need to rebuild it:

```bash
cd ../roseblox-game-engine
npm run build:all
```

This will update the built engine files that the Adventure template uses.
